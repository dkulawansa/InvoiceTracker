PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
===================

Use SQLAlchemy with a database connection (may be PostgreSQL, MySQL, or even SQLite).

Create 2 classes (models) in Python that you can then use to "initialize" an empty database using SQLAlchemy. You will use the SQLAlchemy Declarative system when defining these models so you will be able to use the "create_all" method which will automatically create the tables in the database.

The 2 models will be "Invoice" and "InvoiceItem". They both must have a unique 'id' column as well as be relational using a FOREIGN KEY to the Invoice id on the InvoiceItem model, so the invoice items are linked to their parent invoice. The invoice model should have a date as well. The InvoiceItem model will have an integer column "units", a string column "description" and a numeric column "amount".

Then utilize the classes/models you just created inside a web app built using any Python web framework to expose a single "POST" endpoint so that we can create an invoice via the exposed URL. Then show the new invoice in the database. Add another "POST" endpoint to add an InvoiceItem. We would prefer to see this as a RESTful API, but it is not required.
